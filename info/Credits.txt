Majority of credit goes to UnityPy and it's creator. If it wasn't for it I would've been stuck doing all this in C++ and reverse engineering more stuff and it just wouldn't have been as fun as it was.
UnityPy's Discord was also a huge help! It's creator was very helpful when I had bugs to report and questions to ask
Credit goes to FMOD for letting me YOINK their thingy that lets me do stuff with FSB files without too much pain
Credit goes to quickbms and it's creator who also wrote the bank script I used with it
Credit goes to uTinyRipper, UnityAssetsBundleExtractor, FMOD Bank Tools, and dnSpy. While none of their code is in these files, they made the process
of figuring out how this game worked a LOT easier. I couldn't have done it without them
Credit goes to the guy that invented Python because I forgot how easy Python was compared to stupid C++
Credit goes to VLC Media Player for constantly crashing and breaking files
Credit goes to all my friends that somehow put up with me messaging them at five in the morning "okay I got PART of it working. I'm going to bed for now" every day
Credit probably goes to a bunch of other things that don't realllllyyyyy need credit but I can make a funny joke out of them
Then there's credit for the real reason all this was done. Unbeatable! God I love this game, it's so good. Thank you for making it D-Cell. I wish you the best of luck with the full game
and you bet I'll be buying it right away


I'm no lawyer, I don't know how legal stuff works. If the fact I'm distributing anything in this tool that I shouldn't be is an issue, let me know and I'll try my best to fix it
I'm just some programmer making stuff for a game I like and hoping others will like the thing I make so they can make stuff that I can then go play
I don't mean to get into any legal trouble so yeah just let me know if there's any issues


Oh! Credit also goes to funky, who both made me feel like crap and helped me at the same time. I started modding this game
and had gotten a good amount into it but got a bit stuck. I looked at the Unbeatable guies and saw funky's mod tutorial
It kinda made me sad someone beat me to the punch but they also explained that FMOD Bank Tool exists which saved me a lot of time
So thank you funky for finding FMOD Bank Tool but also frick you because I wanted to be the first to mod this game lmao
jk jk luv you have a good day
