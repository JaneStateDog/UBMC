This is version 0.0


Load the main.exe file. Put in the name for your mod in "New mod file name" then select a location for the file. If you have an existing mod config, you can load that with "Old mod file location".
After doing that, hit "Continue". In the "Game data folder" input make sure you put in the location of your "UNBEATABLE [white label]_Data" folder (you can find this using Steam's browse local files.)
Select a song you'd like to edit, then hit "Edit song". In "Song nickname" you can put a nickname. This doesn't appear in the game at all, it's just to keep track of it through this mod tool.
Put the location of your song file in the "Song file location" (so it could be MP3, WAV, OGG, etc..)
Once you do that, hit "Add beatmap". You can add infinite beatmaps. Put the location of your beatmap in "Beatmap location".
Click "Add". When you're done with your beatmaps, hit "Save".
When you're done with everything, hit the "Save" on the main menu. In the console you'll see text going through.
Let it load for a while, it may take a minute. Once it's finished it should close.
Navigate to the "out" folder (it's in the same folder as main.exe.) In that folder should be a file called "{your mod name}.rar". Extract that file with a program such as 7zip.
You'll get a folder named "UNBEATABLE [white label]_Data". Simply replace the one in the local game files with that new one. And you're done! Load up the game and have fun!


I highly suggest you back up the original game files. It makes it easier.
